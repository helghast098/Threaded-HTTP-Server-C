**How to build:**<br>
`Using cmake:`
Create a directory named build in the main project directory.  On a terminal, navigate to build and type `cmake ..` then `make`.  This will create a directory named httpserver in build that contains an executable named httpserver.

`Using Makefile:`
Type `make` on a terminal that is open to this project.  This will create the server executable named httpserver.

**How to run:**<br>
You can run the server with `./httpserver  [-t threads] [-l logfile] <port number>`. Note, `<port number>` must be greater than 1024 and be an integer.
If no optional arguments are provided, then the default value for threads is 4 and the logfile points to stdout.

    Example input to run httpserver: (No optional arguments)
        ./httpserver 8000
    What this command does is it sets up httpserver to listen on port 8000.

    Example input to run httpserver: (Optional Arguments)
        ./httpserver 8000 -t 5 -l logfile.txt 8000
    Here 5 threads are initialized, the requests to the server are written into logfile.txt, and the server listens on port 8000.

    Example PUT input from client using curl given port is 8000
        curl -X PUT localhost:8000/name.txt --data-raw "Fabert Charles"
    Creates file name.txt with content "Fabert Charles"
